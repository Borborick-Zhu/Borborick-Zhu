# What's up! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Borborick, but please call me Bobo. My full name is too much of a hassle to pronounce. If you are curious though, it is bor-bor-ick. Very phonetic I know. 
I am currently a Sophomore studying Computer Science at UCLA. I have a huge passion in the intersection between health and technology - moreso how tech can become more 
involved in healthcare. 

## My Hobbies ðŸ“«

Since you can see all my coding projects here on Github anyway, I can run you through my hobbies real quick.
* I love playing sports - Ultimate Frisbee, Basketball, Tennis you name it.
* I am also very big into PC hardware - the PC itself, keyboard, mice etc. 
* I love cleaning and cooking. If I didn't study CS I would probably have gone to Culinary School.
